Strafe Helper
=============

Code for drawing a [gazhud](https://www.q3df.org/wiki?p=133)-like HUD overlay
for id Tech 3 engine games, that shows optimal strafing angles. This was written
for the three **id Tech 3** games by Raven Software,
*Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force*, *Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast* and
*Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy*, but it might work fine for other
**id Tech 3** games too.
